    Stackado
================================================================================

    Stack-a-do, a task management system that lets you get distracted or dig
    deeper into the task at hand and come back to whatever you were doing.
    From as many levels deep as you choose to go.

    This module exposes an API that we can use to write command-line app,
    chat-bots or even email or sms-based applications to manipulate our
    todo-stack.
